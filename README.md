Old-Java-Project
================

This is a Java game I made about two years ago as the final project for my AP Computer Science class. I've learned a lot about computer science since then, so the source code I'm including is not indicative of my current programming (or artistic) abilities. Okay, maybe my art hasn't improved.\n
To run the game, open "Antonio APCS Final.jar". You probably need a fairly-recent version of Java to run the game. I've only tested the game on a couple computers and it ran fine on both of them. Since it uses the Java virtual machine, the game should run in Windows (confirmed), Linux (confirmed), and OSX (probably? I don't have a Mac to test it on).
